Welcome to my corner of Github. I am a software engineer at Capital One. I have been taking things apart and putting them back together again since I was a kid. I like knowing how things work and to getting things working. My goal in 2022 is to do and share more of that here. 

- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🛠️ What am I working on: Looking for an open source or side project to jump into!
- 🌱 What am I learning: Kotlin and Golang :)
